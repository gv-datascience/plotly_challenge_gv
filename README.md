########################################   Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard    ###############################################

The purpose of this project is to build a dashboard using data from a study of different bacteria found in people's belly buttons.

In this assignment, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
